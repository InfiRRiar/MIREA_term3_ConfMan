### About the repository

Here I decided to put together all my work I've done during configuration management course at my university (and we *were not* doing configuration management stuff at all, though).

There are 4 completely different projects in that directories, but I've decided to combine them in the reason of a chaotic technology stack I used while they were building. 

Although, I want my GitHub account to be as pure as possible, so please contact with me if you will find any bugs or mistakes.
